# Conditional Statements - Water Meter Calculator
JavaScript

My fictional water meter calculator takes an input through a prompt and calculates a user's bill based on a tiered pricing system.
For example the tiered pricing system for my water meter has these tiers:

Step 1 (0 =< 6kl) = £15.73

Step 2 (>6 =< 10.5kl) = £22.38

Step 3 (>10.5 =< 35kl) = £31.77

Step 4 (>35kl) = £69.76


The bill is output to the user in pounds to the nearest penny.
